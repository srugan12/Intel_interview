# Intel Interview
Demonstration of OOPS concept- Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism- using python <br />
[1] `Abstraction.ipynb` provides an example of abstraction - displaying only relevant data, hence acting as a infrastructure -with the help of `Book` class. The Book class contains methods, that must redeclared in the derived classes, acting as abstract class <br />
[2] `Encapsulation.ipynb` provides an example of encapsulation - grouping together methods and attributes -with the help of `ML_models` class. It shows how different machine learning models which have same target to predict can be grouped together, reducing the need for preprocessing separately. <br />
