# Intel Interview
Demonstration of OOPS concept- Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism- using python <br />
[1] `Abstraction.ipynb` provides an example of abstraction- displaying only relevant data and acting as an infrastructure- with the help of `Book` class. The Book class contains methods, that needs to be redeclared in the derived classes, acting as abstract class <br />
[2] `Encapsulation.ipynb` provides an example of encapsulation- grouping together methods and attributes- with the help of `ML_models` class. It shows how different machine learning models which have same target to predict can be grouped together, reducing the need for preprocessing separately. <br />
[3] `Inheritance_&_Polymorphism.ipynb` provides an example of inheritance- inherit properties of base class- and polymorphism- different ways of looking at same method or atrributes- with the help of `SimpleInterest` and `ComplexInterest` classes.
